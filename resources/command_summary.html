<b>General commands</b>

/subscribe slave_nickname - subscribe to updates from the slave (the message you will receive will be constantly edited)
/unsubscribe slave_nickname - remove slave's updates from your sight
/checkout slave_nickname - see slave's state once
/register_slave - register a new slave (see below)

<b>Connecting your slave</b>

To monitor your own system, you will need to create a client application that will generate status messages and send them to Overseer. It should connect to a remote server at <i>triangle.enricherclub.com:5000</i> through a TLS socket and authenticate. Afterwards, the server will start to listen for the updates from your slave and transmit them to the subscribers.
The command /register_slave will let you set a custom nickname/password pair for the authentication; without the registration, the connection from the client won't be accepted.

<b>Slave-specific commands</b>

I am not ready yet, but with soon you will be able to command your slaves here
